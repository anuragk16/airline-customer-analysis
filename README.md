# Airline Customer Feedback Analysis and Booking Prediction


## Overview
This repository contains two tasks related to analyzing customer feedback for British Airways and predicting customer booking behavior. The first task focuses on scraping and analyzing customer reviews, while the second task involves preparing and modeling a dataset to predict customer bookings. This project is part of my major project during my internship at **Evoastra Ventures**.

## Task 1: Customer Feedback Analysis

### Background
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). With thousands of flights daily, understanding customer feedback is crucial for enhancing their services. This task involves scraping customer reviews from Skytrax and analyzing sentiment to provide insights for improving customer satisfaction.

### Objectives
- **Scrape Customer Reviews**: Collect customer reviews from Skytrax related to British Airways.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of the reviews to determine the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral comments.
- **Identify Key Issues**: Extract factors from negative comments to suggest areas for improvement in customer service.

### Dataset
- The data is scraped from the Skytrax website and contains customer reviews in text format.

### Tools Used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- NLTK or TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
- Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualizations)

### Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive analysis of customer sentiments.
- Identification of key areas for improvement based on customer feedback.
- A PowerPoint presentation summarizing findings and insights.

## Task 2: Booking Prediction Model

### Background
This task involves predicting customer booking behavior based on various features, helping British Airways to enhance their marketing strategies and customer engagement.

### Objectives
- **Explore and Prepare the Dataset**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and prepare it for modeling.
- **Train a Machine Learning Model**: Use a suitable algorithm to predict customer bookings based on the dataset.
- **Evaluate the Model**: Assess model performance using evaluation metrics and visualize feature contributions.

### Dataset Overview
- **Columns**: 
  - `num_passengers`
  - `sales_channel`
  - `trip_type`
  - `purchase_lead`
  - `length_of_stay`
  - `flight_hour`
  - `flight_day`
  - `route`
  - `booking_origin`
  - `wants_extra_baggage`
  - `wants_preferred_seat`
  - `wants_in_flight_meals`
  - `flight_duration`
  - `booking_complete` (target variable)

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualizations)

### Expected Outcomes
- A trained machine learning model that accurately predicts customer bookings.
- Insights into how different features impact booking behavior.
- A PowerPoint presentation summarizing model findings and insights.
